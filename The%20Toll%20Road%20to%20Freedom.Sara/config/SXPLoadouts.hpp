// SXPloadouts.hpp
// Used for defining advanced respawn loadouts for players
// Default behaviour is to check if the player unit has a special loadout defined. Otherwise, it will check to see if the classname matches a loadout
// Advanced functionality allows mission creator to define exactly where items are placed in unit inventories
